      <h2>Top 10 Cyber Threats</h2>
      <img src="images/cyber.jpg" width="250px" class="cyber_img">
      <p>Cyber security threats are malicious and deliberate attacks that seek to steal or damage data, or disrupt digital life in general.</p>
      <p>They are an ever growing risk to individuals, businesses, and governments, cyber crime caused almost $1 trillion in damages in 2020 according to a
      <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hidden-costs-of-cybercrime.pdf">report by McAfee</a>.</p>
      <p>Below are the top 10 cyber threats.</p>
      <ol class="topten">
        <li>Ransomware</li>
        <p>A type of malware attack which the attacker locks or encrypts the victim's data and threatens to publish or perpetually block access unless a ransom is paid.</p>
        <li>Supply Chain Attack</li>
        <p>An attack that seeks to damage an organisation by targetting less secure elements in it's supply chain.</p>
        <li>Malware</li>
        <p>Software intentionally designed to case disruption to a computer.</p>
        <li>Phishing</li>
        <p>A type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent message design to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information.</p>
        <li>Spear Phishing</li>
        <p>A more sophisticated form of phishing where the attacker directly targets a specific organisation or individual.</p>
        <li>Man In The Middle Attack</li>
        <p>A cyber attack where the attacker secretly relays and alters communications between two parties.</p>
        <li>Denial Of Service</li>
        <p>This attack aims to flood systems, networks, and servers with massive amounts of traffic this rendering them unavailable to legitimate requests.</p>
        <li>SQL Injection</li>
        <p>A code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications.</p>
        <li>Zero-Day Exploits</li>
        <p>A software vulnerability for which the vendor of the flawed system is either unaware or has yet to make a patch.</p>
        <li>Cloud Security</li>
        <p>With an increasing reliance on the cloud for data storage comes a higher risk of a major breach.</p>
      </ol>
      <h3>Changing Work Patterns</h3>
      <p>With a recent shift to remote working, businesses now have to face a significant increase in their cyber attack surface as remote workers become targets themselves.</p>
